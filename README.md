# QLDB Serialise

The QLDB Serialiser is a promise-based Node.js ORM for the AWS QLDB Ledger. It is founded on the idea and partially the structure behind Sequelize. For the moment it is using the beta version of the AWS Node.js drivers.

See [AWS Qldb node.js driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs) for more on this. As with the driver it uses I need to stronlgly mention that this is a preview release. For myself it is a testcase connector to see how to integrate QLDB with other applications.

New to Sequelize? Take a look at the [Tutorials and Guides](https://sequelize.org/master). You might also be interested in the [API Reference](https://sequelize.org/master/identifiers).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save qldb-serialiser # Only master is available right now
